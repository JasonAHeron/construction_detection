# Construction Detection
##### Why?
Outside my office at [Disqus] is a construction site. We've set up a camera to take a picture of this site every minute. We have a lot of pictures.

Our intention is to make a time lapse but we'd like to make a time lapse of images just containing actual construction progress.

##### What?
This is my attempt to use tensorflow to do binary image classification.

I want to classify images that contain construction progress.

##### First Approach
I read googles tutorial and started a softmax regression project. I plan on making the model more advanced and applying other ML techniques as I have free time.
